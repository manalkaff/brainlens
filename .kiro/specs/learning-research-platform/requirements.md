# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered learning research platform that automatically researches any topic a user wants to learn, creates comprehensive knowledge trees, and presents information through multiple learning modalities. The platform will integrate with the existing Wasp-based SaaS boilerplate that already includes authentication, payments, and admin functionality.

1. WHEN a user first accesses a topic THEN the system SHALL assess their current knowledge level
2. WHEN knowledge assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL determine their preferred learning style
3. WHEN learning preferences are set THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate starting points
4. WHEN content is delivered THEN the system SHALL adapt difficulty based on user interactions
5. WHEN users interact with content THEN the system SHALL track progress and completion status
6. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators and achievements

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Content Generation and Streaming

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see content being generated in real-time, so that I understand the system is working and can start consuming content as it becomes available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN topic research begins THEN the system SHALL display progressive loading states with descriptive messages
2. WHEN AI generates content THEN the system SHALL stream responses using Vercel AI SDK 4.0
3. WHEN content streams THEN the system SHALL update the UI incrementally without page refreshes
4. WHEN research is in progress THEN the system SHALL show status indicators for each processing stage
5. WHEN content becomes available THEN the system SHALL make it immediately accessible to users

### Requirement 5: Vector-Powered Conversational Learning

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to ask questions about the topic and get contextually relevant answers, so that I can clarify concepts and explore related ideas conversationally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically create embeddings and store in Qdrant vector database
2. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context using RAG
3. WHEN context is retrieved THEN the system SHALL generate responses using the retrieved information
4. WHEN conversations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain chat history and context
5. WHEN multiple conversations exist THEN the system SHALL support thread management
6. WHEN technical topics are discussed THEN the system SHALL support code execution in sandboxed environments

### Requirement 6: Interactive Knowledge Visualization

**User Story:** As a visual learner, I want to see the knowledge structure as an interactive mind map, so that I can understand relationships between concepts and navigate visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MindMap tab is accessed THEN the system SHALL render the knowledge tree using React Flow
2. WHEN nodes are displayed THEN they SHALL be color-coded by completion status and sized by content depth
3. WHEN users click nodes THEN the system SHALL display summaries in tooltips or modals
4. WHEN users double-click nodes THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed content
5. WHEN the mind map is displayed THEN users SHALL be able to zoom, pan, and switch layout modes
6. WHEN users want to save THEN the system SHALL support exporting the mind map as an image

### Requirement 7: Adaptive Assessment and Gamification

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to test my knowledge through quizzes that adapt to what I've studied, so that I can validate my understanding and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a quiz THEN the system SHALL generate questions based on their reading history
2. WHEN quizzes are generated THEN they SHALL include multiple question types (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, code challenges)
3. WHEN quiz difficulty is determined THEN it SHALL adapt based on the user's demonstrated knowledge level
4. WHEN users complete quizzes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations with links to source content
5. WHEN quiz results are available THEN the system SHALL track scores and show improvement trends
6. WHEN achievements are earned THEN the system SHALL display badges and progress indicators

### Requirement 8: Progress Tracking and User Management

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to track my learning progress across topics and sessions, so that I can see my improvement and resume where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with content THEN the system SHALL track time spent and completion status
2. WHEN progress is made THEN the system SHALL update user progress records in the database
3. WHEN users return THEN the system SHALL restore their previous progress and preferences
4. WHEN multiple topics are studied THEN the system SHALL maintain separate progress for each topic
5. WHEN learning sessions occur THEN the system SHALL track engagement metrics and learning patterns
6. WHEN users want to review THEN the system SHALL provide progress dashboards and learning analytics

### Requirement 9: Content Management and Persistence
