# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the AI Learning Agent's content generation system to produce more accessible, learner-friendly content while improving the research strategy to balance academic sources with general knowledge sources. The current system produces overly academic content that is difficult for learners to understand and relies too heavily on academic engines like arXiv.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner using the platform, I want the generated content to be easy to read and understand, so that I can learn complex topics without being overwhelmed by academic jargon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL produce content written in clear, accessible language suitable for general learning
2. WHEN technical terms are used THEN the system SHALL provide simple explanations or definitions inline
3. WHEN content is structured THEN the system SHALL use logical progression from basic concepts to more advanced ones
4. WHEN examples are provided THEN the system SHALL use practical, real-world examples that relate to everyday understanding
5. WHEN content sections are created THEN each section SHALL focus on one main concept with clear explanations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the content to be based on diverse sources including general knowledge, so that I get a well-rounded understanding rather than just academic perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research is planned THEN the system SHALL include at least 5 general search queries by default
2. WHEN recommended engines are used THEN the system SHALL still include general engines alongside specialized ones
3. WHEN research results are collected THEN the system SHALL balance academic sources with general knowledge sources
4. WHEN content is synthesized THEN the system SHALL prioritize practical understanding over theoretical complexity
5. WHEN sources are diverse THEN the system SHALL create content that bridges academic concepts with practical applications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want content that teaches me step-by-step, so that I can build understanding progressively without getting lost in complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL remove user-level customization and focus on universal accessibility
2. WHEN content structure is created THEN the system SHALL organize information in a logical learning sequence
3. WHEN complex topics are explained THEN the system SHALL break them down into digestible components
4. WHEN content flows between sections THEN each section SHALL build upon previous knowledge clearly
5. WHEN takeaways are provided THEN they SHALL be actionable and clearly stated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want content that balances depth with clarity, so that I can understand both the fundamentals and practical applications of a topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research synthesis occurs THEN the system SHALL prioritize clarity over academic rigor
2. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL focus on practical understanding and applications
3. WHEN technical concepts are presented THEN they SHALL be explained with analogies and simple language
4. WHEN content depth is determined THEN the system SHALL ensure comprehensiveness without overwhelming complexity
5. WHEN learning paths are suggested THEN they SHALL be practical and actionable for continued learning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the research planning to be more balanced, so that content draws from both specialized and general knowledge sources effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research plan is created THEN the system SHALL always include 5 general engine queries regardless of topic understanding
2. WHEN engine recommendations are processed THEN the system SHALL supplement them with general searches rather than replace them
3. WHEN research queries are generated THEN they SHALL include both specialized and accessible search terms
4. WHEN research is executed THEN the system SHALL ensure diverse source types are collected
5. WHEN research results are evaluated THEN the system SHALL weight general accessibility alongside academic credibility
