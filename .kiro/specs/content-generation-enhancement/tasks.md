# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance research planning to include mandatory general engine queries
  - Modify the `planResearch()` method in `AILearningAgent` class to always include 5 queries using "general" engine
  - Update the research planning prompt to generate both recommended engine queries and general engine queries
  - Implement logic to combine recommended queries with mandatory general queries
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Update research plan data structure and validation
  - Modify the `ResearchPlanSchema` to track engine distribution
  - Add validation to ensure at least 5 general engine queries are included
  - Update fallback logic to create general engine queries when structured generation fails
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance content generation prompts for accessibility
  - Remove user-level customization from content generation prompts
  - Update content generation prompt to focus on clear, accessible language
  - Add instructions for practical examples and simple explanations of technical terms
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Improve content structure for progressive learning
  - Update content generation to organize information in logical learning sequence
  - Modify prompts to break down complex topics into digestible components
  - Ensure each section builds upon previous knowledge clearly
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Update content synthesis to prioritize practical understanding
  - Modify the `synthesizeResearch()` method to weight general sources appropriately
  - Update synthesis prompts to focus on practical applications over academic theory
  - Ensure synthesis balances academic credibility with accessibility
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Implement enhanced content validation and error handling
  - Add validation for content accessibility and structure
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for content generation failures
  - Ensure content maintains logical flow and clear takeaways
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 7. Update research execution to handle enhanced query distribution
  - Ensure research execution properly handles the mix of general and specialized engine queries
  - Validate that general engine queries are executed successfully
  - Implement proper error handling for engine availability issues
  - _Requirements: 5.5_

- [x] 8. Test and validate enhanced content generation system
  - Test the enhanced system with sample topics to verify improved readability
  - Validate that general engine queries are consistently included
  - Ensure content quality improvements while maintaining comprehensiveness
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 4.4_
