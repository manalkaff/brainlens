# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements to complete the AI-powered learning research platform by fixing critical missing implementations and ensuring all features work as described in the PRD. The current implementation has several gaps that prevent the platform from functioning properly, including missing SearXNG integration, incomplete content generation, and broken RAG system.

## Requirements

4. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL aggregate and deduplicate results across all agents
5. WHEN content is aggregated THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings and store in Qdrant vector database
6. WHEN research completes THEN the system SHALL update topic status and provide real-time progress updates

### Requirement 2: Knowledge Assessment Content Generation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the knowledge assessment to generate personalized learning content based on my responses, so that I receive a tailored learning experience.

6. WHEN learning progresses THEN the system SHALL track and update user progress accurately

### Requirement 3: Explore Tab Content Management System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to see actual generated content in the Explore tab with a proper tree navigation structure, so that I can browse and read comprehensive topic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Explore tab is accessed THEN the system SHALL display a left sidebar with hierarchical topic tree navigation
2. WHEN a topic is selected THEN the system SHALL display generated content in the right content area
3. WHEN content is not available THEN the system SHALL provide a "Generate Content" button with loading indicators
4. WHEN content generation is triggered THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive MDX content based on research results
5. WHEN subtopics are expanded THEN the system SHALL generate child topics on-demand with proper loading states
6. WHEN content is displayed THEN users SHALL be able to bookmark sections and export content

### Requirement 4: Functional RAG-Powered Chat System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to ask questions and receive contextually relevant answers based on the researched content, so that I can clarify concepts and explore ideas conversationally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context from the vector database
2. WHEN context is retrieved THEN the system SHALL generate AI responses using the RAG system with proper prompt engineering
3. WHEN responses are generated THEN they SHALL include source citations and confidence scores
4. WHEN conversations continue THEN the system SHALL maintain proper conversation history and context
5. WHEN new chat threads are created THEN they SHALL be properly initialized with topic context
6. WHEN chat fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5: Working Quiz Generation and Assessment

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to generate and take quizzes based on the content I've studied, so that I can test my knowledge and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Quiz" THEN the system SHALL create questions based on explored content using AI
2. WHEN quizzes are generated THEN they SHALL include multiple question types appropriate for the difficulty level
3. WHEN users answer questions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback with explanations
4. WHEN quizzes are completed THEN the system SHALL calculate scores and update user progress
5. WHEN quiz history is accessed THEN users SHALL see their past performance and improvement trends
6. WHEN quiz generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback template-based questions

### Requirement 6: Vector Database Integration and Operations

**User Story:** As a system, I need proper vector database operations to store and retrieve content embeddings, so that the RAG system can function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL create embeddings using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
2. WHEN embeddings are created THEN they SHALL be stored in Qdrant with proper metadata
3. WHEN searches are performed THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant content using vector similarity
4. WHEN vector operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL update corresponding vector embeddings
6. WHEN vector database is queried THEN results SHALL be ranked by relevance and filtered by topic

### Requirement 7: Real-time Content Streaming and Progress Updates

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to see content being generated in real-time with progress indicators, so that I understand the system is working and can start consuming content as it becomes available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research begins THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates showing agent progress
2. WHEN content is generated THEN it SHALL stream to the UI using Server-Sent Events or WebSockets
3. WHEN streaming occurs THEN the system SHALL show descriptive loading states and progress indicators
4. WHEN agents complete work THEN the system SHALL update progress bars and status messages
5. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and provide retry options
6. WHEN content becomes available THEN it SHALL be immediately accessible without page refreshes

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback when things go wrong, so that I can understand what happened and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN research fails THEN the system SHALL offer retry options and alternative approaches
3. WHEN content generation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to template-based content
4. WHEN vector operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with reduced capabilities
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL cache content and work offline where possible
6. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 9: Content Export and Sharing Features

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to export my learning materials and conversations in various formats, so that I can reference them offline and share with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond quickly and efficiently, so that my learning experience is smooth and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is accessed frequently THEN the system SHALL cache it for faster retrieval
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN they SHALL be cached to avoid redundant API calls
3. WHEN research is performed THEN results SHALL be stored for reuse across similar topics
