# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create Progress Tracking Infrastructure
  - Implement ResearchProgressTracker class with Redis-based state management
  - Define progress state interfaces and Redis key structures
  - Add progress initialization, step tracking, and cleanup methods
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Add Database Content Check to generateContentHandler
  - Modify generateContentHandler to check for existing content before starting research
  - Return existing content immediately if found in database
  - Ensure proper content retrieval and formatting for existing data
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 3. Integrate Progress Tracking into Research Functions
  - Add progress tracking calls to researchAndGenerate function in iterativeResearch.ts
  - Track each of the 6 research steps with start/end times and results
  - Store step details and current status in Redis during research execution
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 4. Separate Main Topic and Subtopic Processing
  - Modify researchAndGenerate to complete main topic processing first
  - Mark main topic as complete in progress state when main research finishes
  - Continue subtopic research in background without blocking main topic completion
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 5. Enhance getResearchStats Operation
  - Modify getResearchStats to retrieve progress state from Redis
  - Add real-time progress information to response including current step and timing
  - Include main topic content when available and subtopic progress status
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 1.4, 2.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Update generateContentHandler API Response Flow
  - Modify generateContentHandler to return success when main topic completes
  - Store main topic content in progress state for immediate frontend access
  - Ensure subtopic research continues in background after API response
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Add Error Handling and Recovery
  - Implement error handling for Redis unavailability with graceful fallback
  - Add error state tracking in progress state for failed research steps
  - Implement recovery strategies for corrupted or missing progress data
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 8. Create Frontend Progress Display Components
  - Build ResearchProgressIndicator component to show current step and progress
  - Create StepResultDisplay component to show completed steps with timing
  - Implement MainTopicContentDisplay for immediate main topic content rendering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 9. Integrate Real-time Progress Updates in Frontend
  - Modify existing polling mechanism to handle enhanced progress data
  - Update frontend to display step-by-step progress during research
  - Implement immediate main topic content display when ready
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.4_

- [ ] 10. Implement Background Subtopic Progress Tracking
  - Add subtopic progress tracking to continue after main topic completion
  - Update progress state with subtopic research status and completion
  - Ensure frontend polling continues to track subtopic progress
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 5.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 11. Add Progress Cleanup and Optimization
  - Implement automatic cleanup of completed progress data with TTL
  - Add Redis performance optimizations using pipelines for batch updates
  - Implement exponential backoff for frontend polling optimization
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 6.4_

- [ ] 12. Final Integration Testing and Validation
  - Test complete end-to-end flow from topic submission to completion
  - Verify real-time progress display works correctly with step-by-step updates
  - Confirm main topic content displays immediately while subtopics continue in background
  - Validate error handling and recovery scenarios work as expected
  - Ensure no mocks or simulations remain in the implementation
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
