# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the learning platform's research and content generation process by providing real-time progress tracking to users. Currently, users submit a topic and wait for the entire process to complete before seeing results. This enhancement will show step-by-step progress during the main topic research phase, display results immediately when the main topic is complete, and continue tracking subtopic generation in the background.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress of the research process so that I understand what's happening and how long each step takes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the research process starts THEN the system SHALL display the current step being executed
2. WHEN a research step completes THEN the system SHALL show the step result and execution time
3. WHEN a new step begins THEN the system SHALL hide the previous step result and show the new step status
4. WHEN the main topic research completes THEN the system SHALL immediately display the generated content
5. IF subtopic research is still running THEN the system SHALL continue showing subtopic progress in the background

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the main topic content as soon as it's ready so that I can start learning without waiting for all subtopics to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main topic research and generation completes THEN the system SHALL display the main topic content immediately
2. WHEN subtopic research is ongoing THEN the system SHALL show subtopic progress indicators
3. WHEN each subtopic completes THEN the system SHALL update the display to show the new subtopic content
4. IF the user navigates away and returns THEN the system SHALL resume showing current progress state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want progress information stored in Redis so that the existing polling mechanism can retrieve real-time updates without requiring WebSockets or SSE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research step starts THEN the system SHALL store step status in Redis with topic ID as key
2. WHEN a research step completes THEN the system SHALL update Redis with step result and timing
3. WHEN get-research-stats is called THEN the system SHALL retrieve current progress from Redis
4. WHEN research process completes THEN the system SHALL clean up Redis progress data after a reasonable timeout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generateContentHandler to check for existing content before starting research so that we don't duplicate work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generateContentHandler is called THEN the system SHALL first check the database for existing content
2. IF content already exists THEN the system SHALL return the existing content without starting research
3. IF content doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL proceed with the research and generation process
4. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in the database as currently implemented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the research process to be decoupled so that main topic completion doesn't wait for subtopic completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN main topic research completes THEN the system SHALL mark the main topic as complete
2. WHEN main topic is complete THEN the system SHALL continue subtopic research in the background
3. WHEN generateContent API call completes THEN the system SHALL return success for main topic completion
4. WHEN subtopics are being researched THEN the get-research-stats polling SHALL continue to track subtopic progress

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the progress tracking to work reliably so that I always see accurate status information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the research process encounters an error THEN the system SHALL store error information in Redis
2. WHEN get-research-stats retrieves error status THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
3. WHEN the research process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle graceful recovery
4. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to basic status tracking without detailed progress
