# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements to fix the subtopic navigation issue in the learning platform's Explore tab. Currently, when users click on subtopics either in the sidebar tree navigation or on the subtopic cards at the bottom of content, the subtopics don't display their content properly and the main content area doesn't update to show the selected subtopic's information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Functional Subtopic Selection in Sidebar

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to click on subtopics in the sidebar tree navigation and see their content immediately, so that I can explore different aspects of the main topic seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a subtopic in the sidebar tree THEN the system SHALL immediately select that subtopic and update the content area
2. WHEN a subtopic is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected subtopic in the sidebar with visual indicators
3. WHEN a subtopic is selected THEN the content header SHALL update to show the subtopic's title and summary
4. WHEN a subtopic has existing content THEN it SHALL be displayed immediately without requiring additional generation
5. WHEN a subtopic doesn't have content THEN the system SHALL show a "Generate Content" button and allow manual content generation
6. WHEN subtopic selection occurs THEN the URL SHALL update to reflect the selected subtopic for proper navigation and bookmarking

### Requirement 2: Working Subtopic Cards Navigation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to click on subtopic cards at the bottom of the main content and navigate to those subtopics, so that I can continue my learning journey through related topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a subtopic card at the bottom of content THEN the system SHALL navigate to that subtopic and display its content
2. WHEN subtopic cards are clicked THEN the sidebar SHALL update to show the selected subtopic as active
3. WHEN navigating via subtopic cards THEN the content area SHALL smoothly transition to show the new subtopic's information
4. WHEN subtopic cards are displayed THEN they SHALL show accurate metadata like complexity level, priority, and estimated read time
5. WHEN a subtopic card is clicked THEN the system SHALL track this navigation for analytics and recent topics
6. WHEN subtopic cards are rendered THEN they SHALL be clickable and provide proper hover states and accessibility

### Requirement 3: Content Generation for Selected Subtopics

**User Story:** As a learner, I want subtopics to automatically generate content when selected, or provide a clear way to generate content manually, so that I can access comprehensive information about each subtopic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subtopic is selected and has no content THEN the system SHALL show a clear "Generate Content" button
2. WHEN the "Generate Content" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive content for that specific subtopic
3. WHEN content is being generated THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and progress feedback
4. WHEN content generation completes THEN the system SHALL immediately display the generated content
5. WHEN content generation fails THEN the system SHALL show error messages and retry options
6. WHEN subtopic content is generated THEN it SHALL be stored and cached for future access

### Requirement 4: Proper State Management for Subtopic Navigation

**User Story:** As a system, I need proper state management for subtopic selection and content display, so that the user interface remains consistent and responsive during navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subtopics are selected THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state across all UI components
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the selected topic state SHALL be properly synchronized between sidebar and content area
3. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL update all relevant state variables and UI indicators
4. WHEN users navigate between subtopics THEN the system SHALL preserve the parent topic context
5. WHEN subtopic selection changes THEN the system SHALL clear previous content and loading states appropriately
6. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL update browser history for proper back/forward navigation

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Subtopic Tree Expansion and Navigation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the topic tree to properly expand and show subtopics when I navigate through the content hierarchy, so that I can understand the relationship between topics and navigate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic has subtopics THEN the tree SHALL show expansion indicators and allow expanding/collapsing
2. WHEN subtopics are expanded THEN they SHALL be displayed in a hierarchical structure with proper indentation
3. WHEN a subtopic is selected THEN its parent topic SHALL remain expanded in the tree view
4. WHEN navigating between subtopics THEN the tree SHALL maintain expansion state for better user experience
5. WHEN subtopics are generated THEN the tree SHALL automatically refresh to show new subtopics
6. WHEN tree navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for the currently selected item

### Requirement 6: Improved Content Display and Metadata

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to see relevant metadata and context when viewing subtopic content, so that I understand the relationship to the main topic and can make informed decisions about my learning path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subtopic content is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the subtopic's relationship to the parent topic
2. WHEN viewing subtopic content THEN the system SHALL display relevant metadata like complexity, estimated read time, and prerequisites
3. WHEN subtopic content is shown THEN the system SHALL provide navigation breadcrumbs showing the topic hierarchy
4. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for the current subtopic within the overall topic
5. WHEN subtopic content includes sources THEN they SHALL be properly attributed and linked
6. WHEN viewing subtopics THEN the system SHALL provide easy navigation back to the parent topic or to sibling subtopics

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully when subtopic navigation or content generation fails, so that I can continue learning without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subtopic selection fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and maintain the previous state
2. WHEN content generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and fallback content
3. WHEN navigation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging while showing user-friendly messages
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL show offline indicators and cached content when available
6. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically retry failed operations and update the UI

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization for Subtopic Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want subtopic navigation to be fast and responsive, so that my learning experience is smooth and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subtopics are selected THEN the navigation SHALL be instantaneous for topics with existing content
2. WHEN content is cached THEN the system SHALL serve it immediately without API calls
3. WHEN multiple subtopics are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies
4. WHEN tree navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL minimize re-renders and optimize component updates
5. WHEN content generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow continued navigation to other subtopics
6. WHEN large topic trees are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization for smooth scrolling
