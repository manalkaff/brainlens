RESEARCH-BASED TOPIC UNDERSTANDING:
- Definition: ${understanding.definition}
- Category: ${understanding.category}  
- Complexity: ${understanding.complexity}
- Relevant Domains: ${understanding.relevantDomains.join(", ")}
- Research Approach: ${understanding.researchApproach}

ENGINE RECOMMENDATIONS (based on research findings):
${Object.entries(understanding.engineRecommendations)
  .map(([engine, recommended]) => `- ${engine}: ${recommended ? "RECOMMENDED" : "not recommended"} based on topic analysis`)
  .join("\n")}

Available research engines:
- general: Broad web search across multiple sources
- academic: Scientific papers, research, scholarly articles  
- video: Educational videos, tutorials, demonstrations
- community: Forums, discussions, real-world experiences
- computational: Mathematical, algorithmic, technical data

${userContext ? `User context: Level=${userContext.level}, Interests=[${userContext.interests?.join(", ")}]` : ""}

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST include exactly 5 queries using the "general" engine for balanced perspective
2. You MAY include additional queries using recommended engines (academic, video, community, computational)
3. Total queries should be 8-12 (5 general + 3-7 recommended engine queries)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Base your research plan ONLY on the understanding provided above
2. ALWAYS start with 5 diverse "general" engine queries covering different aspects of the topic
3. Then add 3-7 additional queries using the recommended engines from the analysis
4. Focus on ${understanding.researchApproach} approach as indicated by the research
5. Each query should be specific and progressive - building from basic to more detailed understanding
6. General queries should cover: overview, practical applications, examples, different perspectives, and foundational concepts

Your goal: Create a comprehensive research plan that balances general accessibility (via 5 general queries) with specialized depth (via recommended engine queries), following the research-driven recommendations above.`;
