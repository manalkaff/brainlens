2. CATEGORY: What primary field/domain does this belong to based on the sources?
   Must be ONE of: academic, technical, cultural, historical, scientific, artistic, business, social, philosophical, practical

3. COMPLEXITY: How complex does this topic appear based on the language and concepts in the sources?
   Must be EXACTLY one of: beginner, intermediate, advanced
   - "beginner": Simple language, basic concepts, introductory level
   - "intermediate": Some technical terms, moderate complexity  
   - "advanced": Complex terminology, expert-level concepts

4. RELEVANT_DOMAINS: What related fields/areas are mentioned in the research?

5. ENGINE_RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on the nature of this topic from research, which search engines would be most valuable?
   - Academic: Would scholarly papers/research be valuable? (true/false)
   - Video: Would visual/video content help explain this? (true/false)
   - Community: Would discussions/forums provide useful insights? (true/false)  
   - Computational: Would quantitative/data analysis be relevant? (true/false)

6. RESEARCH_APPROACH: What approach would work best for deeper research?
   Must be ONE of: broad-overview, focused-deep-dive, comparative, historical

IMPORTANT: Use ONLY the exact enum values specified above. Be analytical and logical. Base your recommendations ONLY on what the research sources reveal about this topic.`;
