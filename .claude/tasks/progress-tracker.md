3. **Phase 3 Learning Interface** - User-facing value delivery
4. **Essential Phase 4 Features** - RAG system, basic export
5. **Phase 5 Production Setup** - Scalable deployment

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:
1. **SearXNG Dependencies** - Have fallback search implementations
2. **OpenAI API Limits** - Implement rate limiting and caching
3. **Vector Database Performance** - Start with smaller collections, optimize later
4. **Real-time Features** - Begin with polling, upgrade to streaming
