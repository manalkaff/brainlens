# Task 2: Remove Unused Function

## Problem
The function `processSubtopicsRecursively` in `iterativeResearch.ts` is no longer being used and should be deleted to clean up the codebase.

## Current State Analysis
- Location: `app/src/learning/api/iterativeResearch.ts:313-384`
- Function: `processSubtopicsRecursively`
- Status: Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
- Replacement: `processSubtopicsInBackground` is the current implementation

## Investigation Required
Before deletion, verify that this function is truly unused by:

1. **Search for any references**:
   - Check if function is called anywhere in the codebase
   - Look for any imports or exports
   - Verify no dynamic calls or string references

2. **Check git history**:
   - Understand when it was last used
   - Confirm replacement by `processSubtopicsInBackground`

## Implementation Steps

1. **Verify function is unused**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "processSubtopicsRecursively" app/src/
   ```

2. **Remove the function**:
   - Delete lines 313-384 in `iterativeResearch.ts`
   - Remove any related helper methods if they become unused
   - Check for any TypeScript interfaces or types that are only used by this function

3. **Clean up related code**:
   - Check if `chunkArray` helper method is still needed (line 870-876)
   - Remove any imports that are no longer needed
   - Update any comments that reference the old function

## Files to Modify
- `app/src/learning/api/iterativeResearch.ts` (primary)

## Validation
- Function is completely removed from codebase
- No compilation errors after removal
- No runtime errors in application
- Search confirms no references remain

## Testing
- Run TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc`
- Start application and test topic research functionality
- Verify subtopic processing still works with `processSubtopicsInBackground`

## Success Criteria
- ✅ `processSubtopicsRecursively` function completely removed
- ✅ No references to the function remain in codebase
- ✅ Application compiles without errors
- ✅ Topic research functionality unaffected
- ✅ Run `npx tsc` without errors
